1768,412878,"Casa Bella, Crystal Harbour ",usd,5195000,Residential,"Single Family Home","W Bay Bch North","<p>Designed for his family by award winning architect Mike Stroh from Trio Architecture, Casa Bella is a spectacular, and rare, opportunity in Crystal Harbour, Grand Cayman. A meticulous undertaking for any architect, to Mike the design presented an opportunity to ‘practice what he preaches’ to its fullest expression. Casa Bella was short listed for the prestigious Governor’s Award for Design Excellence, in 2015.</p>
<p>Located in the heart of the Seven Mile Beach corridor, the physical fabric of the house entwines Key West and contemporary Caribbean design initiatives, solidifying the design’s sense of place in the landscape. Perfect for a family and for the discovery of balance between built form and nature, the home is a lush tropical oasis nestled amongst indigenous plant life. The vegetation includes flowering, fruit bearing, shade providing, and drought tolerant flora; each element of the landscape establishing a livable habitat for local fauna and featuring the pool, built in jacuzzi, and canal.</p>
<p>The communal areas, such as the living room, dining room, kitchen and breakfast area all harness views of the canal, pool, and lush landscaping. Each zone opens to the expansive outdoor entertaining area that runs the full length of the home.</p>
<p>From the moment you enter each space you are emersed in an elegant, yet personable, design that pays tribute to the value of craftsmanship and attention to detail. As you enter the chef’s kitchen you are greeted with marble countertops, an impressive island bench, double ovens, a Thermador stove, a farmhouse sink, large pantry, side by side fridge and freezer, and detailed cabinetry. The kitchen also extends into the outdoor entertaining area; featuring a built in BBQ area that includes a fridge, sink, and substantial counterspace under a trellis shaded area.</p>
<p>The breezeway’s double height volume to the West serves to bridge the space between the main house and the guest quarters, while also acting as a grand entrance. Surrounded by aromatic frangipanis and passing through twelve-foot-high white oak louvred doors, you are immediately greeted by uninterrupted trade winds and one of the many outdoor lounge areas.</p>
<p>The design offers both communal living and independence for the inhabitants. Organized on two levels and connected by a grand staircase which leads you up to the private family living area with built-in cabinets and desks. The incredible, large master suite showcases an amazing vaulted, exposed wood and beamed ceiling, private patio, and large bathroom featuring a stunning bath and separate built-in sinks. The master suite walk-in closet is a dream come true with a large island, substantial built in cabinet space, a vanity area, and a window to bring in natural light.  Each of the three other upstairs bedrooms include their own en-suite bathroom and built-in closets.</p>
<p>Environmentally friendly and energy efficient – the home contains sustainable building techniques blended with high end finishes. Evident in design features such as the functional Bahama shutters on the exterior, and the Plantation shutters on the interior, both which harness the local vernacular while also regulating the sunlight and creating a more energy efficient home. High Seer A/C units and solar panels with 3 Tesla wall batteries further contribute to the dwelling’s energy efficiency, resulting in next to zero electricity bills. Furthermore, LED lights have been applied throughout, liquid propane appliances were selected over conventional ones, and a heat pump was installed in the garage to provide a constant supply of hot water, while also cooling the space around it.</p>
<p>The home also features a separate staff bedroom with en-suite bathroom located off the main kitchen, generous amount of storage space in the attic, and a large garage with built in cabinets.
